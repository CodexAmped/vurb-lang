# Programming Language

This is the implementation of BASIC language.

The first thing we need to create, is the Lexer.
## Lexer

This spits up the inputs into tokens, which allows us to identify what everything is. For example, if the input is `10 + 20 * 45 - 0.3`, Leser will be able to ideentify that the value `10` is of the token type integer(TT_INT), `+` is of the token type addition(TT_PLUS), '*' is of the token type multiplication(TT_MUL), `45` is of the token type integer(TT_INT), and we have MINUS with token type of minus(TT_MINUS) and lastly we have floating number with the value of 0.3 with token type of floating_numner(TT_FLOAT).

## Parser

The idea of the parser, is to build up the syntax tree of the program from the tokens created by the Lexer.

e.g 1
1 + 2 * 3
             [BinOp(PLUS)]
                  /\
                 /  \
      [Number(1)] [BinOp(MUL)]
                        /\
                       /  \
              [Number(2)] [Number(3)]

(INT:1,PLUS,(INT:2,MUL,INT:3))

In the example above, the tree is generated by the expression: `1 + 2 * 3`.
The tree tells us what operations have to be performed, and also gives us the exact order. This tree is stacked to the plus[BinOp(PLUS)] binary operation and this lets the program know that the node on the right and on the left side have to be added together

e.g 2
(1 + 2) * 3
             [BinOp(MUL)]
                  /\
                 /  \
      [BinOp(PLUS)] [Number(3)]
            /\
           /  \
  [Number(1)] [Number(2)]

((INT:1,PLUS,INT:2),MUL,INT:3)
